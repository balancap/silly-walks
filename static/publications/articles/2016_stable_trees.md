In this work, we investigate the spectrum of singularities of random stable trees with parameter \(\gamma\in(1,2)\). We consider for that purpose the scaling exponents derived from two natural measures on stable trees: the local time \(\ell^a\) and the mass measure \(\textbf{m}\), providing as well a purely geometrical interpretation of the exponent defined by the latter.
We first characterise the uniform component of the multifractal spectrum which exists at every level \(a>0\) of stable trees and corresponds to large masses with scaling index \(h\in [\tfrac{1+\gamma}{\gamma},\tfrac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}]\) for the mass measure (or equivalently \(h\in [\tfrac{1}{\gamma},\tfrac{1}{\gamma-1}] \) for the local time). In addition, we investigate the distribution of vertices appearing at random levels with exceptionally large masses of index \(h\in [0,\tfrac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}) \). Finally, we discuss more precisely the order of the largest mass existing on any subset \(\mathcal{T}(F)\) of a stable tree, characterising the former with the packing dimension of the set \(F\).
