The inner thoracic region consists of several important anatomical structures and an accurate delineation of this region is an essential step for various biomedical image analysis applications. In this paper, we present a fully automatic graph-based method for the delineation of the inner thoracic region in non-contrast cardiac CT data. In particular, we reformulate the problem of delineating the inner thoracic region as an optimal surface segmentation problem, the solution to which is obtained by computing the minimum-cost closed set in a node-weighted directed graph. Comparing the results obtained using our method with manual segmentations performed by an expert on non-contrast cardiac CT scans of 20 randomly selected patients indicated an overlap of 99.1 Â± 0.2%.
