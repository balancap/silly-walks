Let \(B^H = \{ B^H(t), t\in\mathrm{R}^N \}\) be an \((N,d)\)-fractional Brownian sheet with Hurst index \(H=(H_1,\dotsc,H_N)\in (0,1)^N\). The main objective of the present paper is to study the Hausdorff dimension of the image sets \(B^H(F+t)\), \(F\subset\mathrm{R}^N\) and \(t\in\mathrm{R}^N\), in the dimension case \(d<\tfrac{1}{H_1}+\cdots+\tfrac{1}{H_N}\). Following the seminal work of Kaufman (1989), we establish uniform dimensional properties on \(B^H\), answering questions raised by Khoshnevisan et al (2006) and Wu and Xiao (2009). 

For the purpose of this work, we introduce a refinement of the <em>sectorial local-nondeterminism</em> property which can be of independent interest to the study of other fine properties of fractional Brownian sheets.
