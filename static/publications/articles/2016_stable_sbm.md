We investigate in this work the spectrum of singularities of super-Brownian motion with stable branching. The main purpose is to provide a uniform description of the latter in high dimension \(d\geq\tfrac{2}{\gamma-1}\), presenting the singularities existing at every time \(t\) and characterising as well the set of random times at which singularities of higher order appear. In lower dimensions, we give a partial description of the singularities which complement the recent study of the density by Mytnik and Wachtel (2015).
